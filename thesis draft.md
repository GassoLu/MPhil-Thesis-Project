# Import Exchange Rate Pass-Through and Financial Constraints

## 1. Introduction

Why did exchange rate fluctuations not result in price changes of the same magnitude? This is one of the core questions among a set of "exchange rate disconnect" puzzles. As price signals in the international trade market, exchange rates appear less informative for firms than expected. Estimates of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT), which describe the elasticity of local price changes to exchange rate fluctuations, vary widely across countries, industries, and time.

In previous literature, most micro explanations and empirical evidence based on disaggregated data for incomplete exchange rate pass-through focus on the exporter sides. Exporters' productivity (Berman, Martin, and Mayer, 2012; Li, Ma, and Xu, 2015) and product quality (Chen and Juvenal, 2016; Auer, Chaney, and Sauré, 2018), as well as their imported inputs (Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings, 2014; Wang and Yu, 2021) and market shares (Auer and Schoenle, 2016; Devereux, Dong, and Tomlin, 2017), will all affect the export exchange rate pass-through. Yet the direct role of importers in determining exchange rate pass-through remains a novel field to study. 

Financial constraints, discussed in another strand of literature, also demonstrate some influence on firms’ response in price-setting decisions to exchange rate fluctuations. Strasser (2013) finds that financially constrained exporters adjust prices in the destination market more sharply when facing exchange rate shocks, implying a more complete exchange rate pass-through. However, it is an open question whether importers under financial constraints will behave differently in price negotiation during exchange rate shocks. Therefore, credit constraints provide an innovative entry point for us to study the import exchange rate pass-through.

In this paper, we focus on the role of importers in the determination of exchange rate pass-through and connect it with the importers' financial constraints. This paper tends to fill a gap in the literature by linking both sides of the trade relationship and provides a novel perspective to study the nature of exchange rate disconnect for emerging markets, where firms are more vulnerable to credit constraints due to immature financial markets. In contrast to the conventional framework of exchange rate pass-through where importers are mostly price takers, we contribute to the trade literature by identifying the importers' implicit sourcing power in the bilateral partnership by comparing their heterogeneous capacity to absorb exchange rate shocks.

We estimate the import exchange rate pass-through as the price elasticity of import prices with respect to real exchange rates using Chinese firm-level data. Specifically, we merge the Chinese Industrial Enterprises datasets with the China customs records and adopted fixed effect panel regressions specification with first-order differences to capture the changes in product prices and real exchange rates. The average import exchange rate pass-through is between 35%-40%, which is more incomplete compared to the 95% export pass-through. Second, we identify the effects of credit constraints on importers' exchange rate pass-through. I use both US measures of sectors’ financial vulnerability (Manova, Wei, and Zhang, 2015) and Chinese measures of credit needs (Fan, Lai, and Li, 2015). In our baseline results, import prices in sectors with large financial constraints are more sensitive to exchange rate shocks. Third, we study some potential channels under which credit constraints may affect the import pass-through. We estimated the firm-level markup and total product productivities (TFP) following Loecker and Warzynski (2012). We find that credit constraints still affect import pass-through significantly even if we control both markup or TFP effects. 

We show that importers‘ credit constraints influence price-setting patterns in international trade. We provide evidence that (1) average import exchange rate pass-through levels in China are significantly less complete than export ones; and (2) financial constraints will increase both of them to be more complete. In other words, financially constrained importers will absorb more price fluctuations caused by exchange rate changes, while financially constrained exporters pass through more exchange rate changes to prices, compared to those unconstrained firms. This reflects that binding financial constraints will lead to not only narrow margins to adopt pricing-to-market strategies for the sellers but also limited sourcing power for the buyers.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a more detailed literature review. Section 3 describes the data and measurements we used. Section 4 describes the stylized patterns of import exchange rate pass-through. Section 5 shows the main empirical results about credit constraints and import exchange rate pass-through. Section 6 provides robustness checks. Section 6 concludes.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Incomplete Exchange rate pass-through

First, our paper contribute to a wide literature on the exchange rate disconnect (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2001) and particularly on the incomplete pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations into international prices. Campa and Goldberg (2005) document the lack of sensitivity of  prices to exchange rate movements and provide estimates of the pass-through of exchange rates into import prices of 23 OECD countries. Berman, Martin, and Mayer (2012) (henceforth, BMM) provide micro-level evidence of firm heterogeneity in response to real exchange rate shocks. Another milestone paper by Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2014) (henceforth, AIK) find that firms with higher import intensity and market shares have lower exchange rate pass-through. Since then, more studies link the exchange rate elasticity or pass-through to disaggregated firm-level characteristics.

We summarize three major channels leading to incomplete export price pass-through proposed by past literature. The first channel is local currency pricing (LCP). As surveyed by Engel (2002), it means short-run nominal rigidities with prices sticky in the destination currency. Under LCP, the firms that do not adjust prices have zero short-run pass-through. Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) introduces the stickiness and currency of pricing of traded goods into the discussion and provide direct evidence on the extent of LCP in US import and export prices during 1994-2005.  However, price rigidities can not fully explain the incomplete pass-through.

The second channel is pricing-to-market (PTM). It is from variable markups in which firms optimally choose different prices depending on destination market conditions. Atkeson and Burstein (2008) provide a recent quantitative investigation of the PTM channel and its implication for aggregate prices. BMM (2012) finds that more productive firms respond to exchange rate changes by changing more markup rather than volume, which allows them to pass only a fraction of exchange rate shocks to their terminal prices. Manova and Zhang (2012) also support that variable mark-ups and product quality across destinations should be considered to explain ERPT patterns. 

Gopinath, Itskhoki, and Rigobon (2010) about currency choice and Gopinath and Itskhoki (2010) about price adjustment frequency, further combine the above two channels. They show that the PTM and LCP channels of incomplete pass-through interact and reinforce each other, with highly variable-markup firms endogenously choosing to price in local currency as well as adopting longer price durations. If more firms were to adjust prices infrequently, the exchange rate pass-through would decline.

The third channel is the marginal production cost.  While local distribution cost could result in incomplete pass-through into consumer prices, the imported inputs channel by AIK (2014) can affect producer factory gate prices. For example, an appreciation of home currency will decrease marginal costs due to cheaper imported inputs, thus partially offsetting the increases in export prices. The linkage between import behaviors and export pass-through helps understand low aggregate exchange rate pass-through and variation in pass-through across exporters. 

Chatterjee, Dix-Carneiro, and Vichyanond (2013) study the effect of exchange rate shocks on multi-product firms.

Recent literature reveals more firm-level evidence on heterogeneous pass-through. Chen and Juvenal (2014) predict more pricing-to-market and a smaller response of export volumes for higher quality goods and provide evidence with experts wine ratings to measure quality. Garetto (2016) make two more arguments: 1) firm-level ERPT is a U-shaped function of firm-level productivity and market share; and 2) producers under incomplete information, such as new entrants, have lower pass-through rates than those under complete information. Likewise, Auer and Schoenle (2016) also find U-shaped relationship between response of import prices to exchange rate changes and exporter market share with micro-data. Devereux, Dong, and Tomlin's (2017)'s novel feature are that ERPT and currency invoicing depend on the market share of both importers (negative) and exporters (U-shaped). It menas very small or very large exporters have higher rates of pass-through and tend to invoice in the foreign currency.
