# Import Exchange Rate Pass-Through and Financial Constraints

## 1. Introduction

Why did exchange rate fluctuations not result in price changes of the same magnitude? This is one of the core questions among a set of "exchange rate disconnect" puzzles. As price signals in the international trade market, exchange rates appear less informative for firms than expected. Estimates of exchange rate pass-through, which describe the elasticity of local price changes to exchange rate fluctuations, vary widely across countries, industries, and time.

In previous literature, most micro explanations and empirical evidence based on disaggregated data for incomplete exchange rate pass-through focus on the exporter sides. Exporters' productivity (Berman et al. 2012; Li et al., 2015) and product quality (Chen and Juvenal, 2016; Auer et al., 2018), as well as their imports (Amiti et al., 2014, Wang and Yu, 2021) and market shares (Auer and Schoenle, 2016; Devereux et al., 2018), will all affect the export exchange rate pass-through. Yet the role of importers in determining exchange rate pass-through remains a novel field to study. 

Financial constraints, discussed in another strand of literature, will affect the response of firms’ price-setting decisions to exchange rate fluctuations. Financially constrained exporters adjust prices in the destination market more sharply when facing exchange rate shocks, which implies a more complete exchange rate pass-through.

In this paper, we tend to focus on the role of importers in the determination of exchange rate pass-through and connect it with the importers' financial constraints. We believe that importers‘ firm characteristics in international trade can also influence price-setting patterns, especially if these firms also export at the same time, whom we called "two-way traders".
